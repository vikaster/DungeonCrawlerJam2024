Spawn notes BEFORE the music gets to them

- Choose how long the player has to react. EG 2 seconds.
- Calculate how long the note takes to get to the middle point based on its speed. (Speed can be changed)
- How to know when a note is coming up in the future?



Possible Solution 1
- Create as many notes as needed at the start, offscreen.
- Let each note know by what beat it should arrive in the center by
- Its x position should be based on that (using lerp?)
